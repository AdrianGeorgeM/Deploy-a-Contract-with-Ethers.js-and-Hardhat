# Sample Hardhat Project

Newly-deployed contract address as terminal output - nice!

Faucet address: 0x88B55f4c84FF0FA4f41B100E084db8C5162cE95D

Copy-paste that address into https://goerli.etherscan.io/ and check out my
contract in live deployment form!

## What is this?

Can you think of any extra features to add to your faucet? How about some sort
of way of keeping track of user addresses that have already used it? Or
timestamps to limit mass withdrawals all at once?
